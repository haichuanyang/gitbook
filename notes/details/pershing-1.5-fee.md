SPAC

Ackman did have widely publicized rough patch from 2015 to 2017, when the fund returned negative 43%, way behind the S\&P 500’s 38% total return.

Part of the reason is a hefty fee structure. The base management fee is 1.5% annually, with an incentive fee of 16% a year. With the fund above its high-water mark, it is earning that incentive fee. The rocky performance several years ago likely is a contributor to the discount.



Some investors engage in arbitrage of buying the fund and shorting its top holdings to play a potential narrowing in that discount. So far this year, that strategy has worked wonderfully.
