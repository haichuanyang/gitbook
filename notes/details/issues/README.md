knapsack from 1D back to 2D array problem

&#x20;\- complete knapsack must iterate i 0 to n; j 0 to m all the way through

`f[i][j]=f[i-1][j]`

`if(j>i) f[i][j]+=f[i][j-i]`

unique() function undefined behavior for removed elements?

`// sort words alphabetically so we can find the duplicates sort(words.begin(), words.end());`\
&#x20;`// unique reorders the input range so that each word appears once in the front portion of the range and returns an iterator one past the unique range`&#x20;

`auto end_unique = unique(words.begin(), words.end());`&#x20;

two literal strings can't add

map allows subscripting using brackets \[], as array does
