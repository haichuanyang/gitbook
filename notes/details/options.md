**CC/PW** (stands for Covered Call/Put Write information). **PA** is the per annum return on a covered call or a cash-covered put if there is no change in the price of the underlying stock. **PT** stands for how far the stock can fall at expiration for the position to break even. **MX** is the maximum return on the position.

buying protective puts or selling covered calls both said to be effective.

**Covered call writing= holding stock and sell calls on them; call strike price>current price; call can be short-term; CC is best for stable stock for long term holdings; CC** makes the most sense when option premiums are overpriced and when the investor does not expect a tremendous amount of volatility. While covered call writing offers less-than-full coverage of one’s exposure, it is often the preferred way to reduce the risk of one’s portfolio, especially if premiums are high.&#x20;

**protective puts** : if you expect a lot of volatility, but are uncertain about the direction, then buy the at-the-money put. more bullish than bearish = out of money put;  in the money put = essentially selling off your stock, but insuring yourself against the wrong decision by retaining the right to some upside potential if the stock makes a really large upward move.

married put = owning a stock and buy its put;&#x20;

low premium out-of-the-money index puts are often overpriced compared to the actual protection that they offer

bear put spread=buys one put (usually at-the-money) and then sells another lower-strike put (which is usually out of-the-money).

“**hedging with a collar**” is write a call against the stock you own to take in premium, and at the same time buy a lower strike put to cover the potential downside. A “collar” can be structured any number of ways, but most often is set up so that the premium received from writing the call pays for buying the put. This is called a “costless collar.” Another popular collar configuration is to write an at-the **** money call, taking in a relatively large premium, and then buying a lower strike, out-of-the-money put for a relatively smaller premium. With this type of structure, the investor collects a net premium and, at the same time, benefits from having the position protected against a really sharp downward move.

**bear call spreads** instead of naked selling calls involve selling close-to-the- money calls and buying out-of-the-money calls. This will limit losses to the portfolio hedge when the underlying stocks rise.

**Writing Naked Calls** In this strategy, investors hedge their portfolio by writing “naked” calls (i.e. calls on stocks that are not in the portfolio). If the stocks underlying these calls end up below their strike prices, then investors will end up keeping all of the call premiums. Moreover, investors give up none of the upside potential of their own stocks. The main disadvantage of covered portfolio writing is the possibility that the stocks underlying the calls can rise, while stocks in the portfolio can stand still or decline. To offset the risk of this type of hedge moving sharply in the wrong direction, investors might consider substituting bear call spreads for these “naked” short calls. These spreads involve selling close-to-the- money calls and buying out-of-the-money calls. This will limit losses to the portfolio hedge when the underlying stocks rise

In addition, with the covered call, you have to worry about the possibility that the in the-money call will be exercised before expiration. Usually, this only happens when the stock has an ex-dividend date shortly before expiration. The ex-dividend date is the day on which the company identifies the owner of the stock. Thus, the holder of the long call might want to exercise the call (i.e. buy the stock) before expiration.&#x20;

Simple rules of thumb are: if the stock is above the strike price, then it makes more sense to write the cash-covered put. If the stock is below the strike price, then the covered call makes more sense.

Analysis of our performance record, which goes back to the first quarter of 1980, indicates that a portfolio of **87% cash, 3% put buys and 10% call buys** would produce the best results if your desired relative volatility was 37%, about the same as a growth stock mutual fund. This, of course, is hardly a no-risk strategy with losses occurring approximately one-third of the time. Based on call and put premiums being in the $1.00 to $5.00 per-share range, a portfolio of 15 to 20 different option positions might require between $3,000 to $7,000 in premiums and between $25,000 and $35,000 to pursue this strategy.
