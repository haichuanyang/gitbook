description: first is ROC before anything else - how could you missed that?

# checklist



1. **business moats are first thing to look - durable moats, hidden moat, low-cost producer**
2. **mistakes are inevitable, trial and error is very important**
3. **quality of management people,**&#x20;
4. **avoid leverage**
5. **insurance - need reinsurance, float investing, lending business; look for good people, be patient, don't force the issue, let the thing come to you, find bargain, net-net, below book value, patience**
6. ****
7. **Must have instituition holdings, big instituitions guarantees no bankrupt! Must be owned by big institutions, the more the better. Don’t touch those without big institution ownings!**

&#x20;**Must be known big famous institutions you know already; otherwise avoid! >50%**

1. **Quality first, before all the numbers;**&#x20;
2. **No doubtful management personnel!**
3. **看现有池，面临所有选择的, P/B, P/E(P/FCF)， 比较哪个更优; p/b compare to its own pb history past 7 years; fcf history last 5 years**
4. **假不假，看分红; foreign stocks dividends are very important, maybe only thing that can count on; KEP, ESV, SDLP, PTR/SNP/CEO; yrd is definitely not UHUAL, china can’t have companies that are shareholder oriented, it simply doesn’t have the environment. 否则段永平就不会万里迢迢到美国来找uhaul, GE, AAPL,netease; 他在中国找不到，你怎么可能找得到？陈天桥对中国的失望不言而喻！**
5. &#x20;**calculate your own number from annual reports, both google finance and s\&p netadvantage show wrong numbers, very basic numbers wrong! Mstar, vl, fido research, yahoo finance**
6. **use price alerts/price trigger to buy, don’t jump in and impromptu, adjust your alerts and triggers instead, wait for signal, don’t go in and buy, don’t chase price trends**
7. **look for moat, price setting power, price deciding power, industry leader, look for what people want/need, not the laggards like HPQ, XRX, blackberry no matter how good their numbers look like, BIDU/GOOG vs. YAHOO**
8. **first is book value, and book value growth (rate over past 10 years), tangible book value, generally P/B < 1.2, not 2.25. Check p/b against industry average. p/b p/fcf changing every day, so need to check for big changes.**&#x20;
9. **second is earnings and FCF(essentially the same), FCF yield>10, P/E <15， 看 PE10, check past P/E history highs and lows, comparing with current P/E, price history highs and lows, check price history over 2008/09, note the report date, earnings history from vl and sp, no negative earnings(loss), earnings growth (the more the better), sales/revenue growth**
10. **third check debt, generally debt < wc, debt < equity, working capital should be going up, current ratio = current assets/current liabilities >1, cap\<wc very good**
11. **repurchase/buy-back program is in place, in annual report (#shares should go down)**
12. **check fido/yahoo/google/mstar news for latest earnings release news, results, institutional holder transaction trends, last year price should be up**
13. **check mstar industry peers, compare market capitalization PTR vs. XOM, compare china vs. US, peers in sp advantage report, peers in google finance, mstar key stats section compare with industry average;  financials-cash flow statement! p/b p/fcf changing every day, so need to check for big changes. Also check p/b against industry average.**
14. **check fido research reports, it has all current SEC filings, no way to keep track, have to check weekly yourself, no alert system, analyst opinion only a reference**

**Check put/call ratios for overall market direction:**
