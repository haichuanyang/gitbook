pstvy is not traded - no buyer even if it rises! ??? liquidity problem? no sold one at 13.45 and both one back at 14; personally not like lowes < Home depot; facebook useless but its stock is different thing

1/14/2021 didn't buy more of pstvy - wasted one whole day and missed 10% rise! could have been all in; thumb sucking - slow mover
