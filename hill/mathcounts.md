2011 national target #8: parity of a-b is same as a+b; so numbers that can be expressed as a^2-b^2 are 4 multiples or odd numbers; below 2011 there are 502 4-multiples and 1005 odd numbers; out of those 1 and 4 involves 0 and can't be included; answer = 2010-(502+1005)+2=505

2016 state sprint 10 wrong out of 30 - #27 only one left not explained; redo 8, 11, 12 15 16 20 25 27 28 29; sqrt(8) never should exist - trike 3 out of 4 tires problem

2019 to 2017 state sprint done - 2016 state target she said she did it;&#x20;



redo:

2013 state target 5 ratio easy 6 line perpendicular segment length 7 number with 8 factors  8 geometry right triangle need redo; 2018 target 8 pages of books;&#x20;

2016 state sprint 10 wrong out of 30 - #27 only one left not explained; redo 8, 11, 12 15 16 20 25 27 28 29; sqrt(8) never should exist - trike 3 out of 4 tires problem

[https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/mathcounts](https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/mathcounts) AOPS guy explains many problems very nicely

past - 2010 state sprint; 2006 state target

2020 school targets and sprints done to 2015; switched to 2014 chapter target and sprint; 2016 chapter target number 8 did her own solution is much better than the standard provided solution:

![](../.gitbook/assets/IMG\_20210118\_200956.jpg)

2013 chapter sprint next; 2013 chapter target was done



```
Aops guy explains quite clearly
2009 is his earliest year, 2009 2010 2011 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019done

divided by year -  he skipped the 2 hardest problems of 2019.

To find the number of rectangles in a grid, if n = the # of horizontal lines and m = the # of vertical lines, the number of rectangles is nC2 * mC2 (where C means combination) because to make a rectangle, you pick two horizontal lines and two vertical lines. In the first problem, there were 4 horizontal lines and 3 vertical lines. 4C2 * 3C2 = 6 * 3 = 18 rectangles.

x+1/y=1, y+1/z=1, xyz=?

try out numbers; plug in any number, x=2 eg, y=-1, z=1/2; that gives xyz=-1

doing sth stupid

yz times eq 1; z time eq 2

or xyz=(1-1/y)yz=yz-z=z(y-1)=z(-1/z)=-1!
